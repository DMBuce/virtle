Virtle README
=============

libvirt wrapped in a shell.

Description
-----------

Virtle is a small collection of bash scripts used to make managing libvirt VMs
more intuitive. A configuration file is used to provide options for many of the
difficult-to-remember `virsh` and `virt-install` flags.

Installation
------------

To install, edit the variables at the top of the Makefile to match your system
and run

	make install

The Makefile also supports DESTDIR for staged installs.

	make DESTDIR=/tmp/staging install

//Usage
//-----
//
//Refer to the `--help` output for each utility.
//

/////
vim: set syntax=asciidoc ts=4 sw=4 noet:
